# AI Data Factory
We have all heard the phrase "Data is the new oil". Indeed, data in the 21st Century is like Oil in the 18th Century: an immensely, untapped valuable asset. Weâ€™re in a digital economy where data is more valuable than ever. Luckily getting data is not as difficult as building an oil refinery or an industrial plant where crude oil is transformed and refined.

We present a minimalistic python package ```aidatafactory``` which generates artificial data.
It uses a generative model Variational Auto Encoder, inspired by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02691.pdf). With Google Colab you can check the [showcase](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rVgi0_4viqK_Mqd_9-Bs6E-I8l_9LvXJ) of ```aidatafactory``` where you can interactively play with its functionalities. If you are interested in the source code, please check ```aidatafactory/factory.py``` file.

## Install
